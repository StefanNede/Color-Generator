# Color-Generator
# Open the index.html page, and from then click the generate colors button, for random colors to be generated.
# If you like a color you can lock it in, by pressing the lock.
# All 5 colors will be randomly generated but should be quite close, so that they look 'nice' together.
# Under each color there is the rgb code, you can copy this, and then use it in another place.
